# Workbench Template - Lexicon

> Generated from LLM Workbench v3.2.0.

**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-08
**Status:** [active / partial / stale]

This is the canonical lookup table for terms whose meaning is shared across the
project. Read it when a request, spec, test, or skill uses project language that
could be ambiguous.

## Task Routing

The ordinary entry route is `AGENTS.md` -> `RUNBOOK.md` -> `LEXICON.md`.
Continue to the assigned `SPEC.md` resolved through `workbench/manifest.json`.
Use `BLUEPRINT.md` for architecture and cross-cutting direction; use the
manifest-declared Wiki `MEMORY.md` for task-relevant durable knowledge and the
ADR `REGISTER.md` for decision rationale. Read only the relevant linked owners.
`TASKBOARD.md` is a dashboard, not a prerequisite reading archive.

These are the Context Map's entry routes. Follow the smallest applicable route:

| Need | Route to the owner |
|---|---|
| Accepted terminology and product direction | This Lexicon -> [Blueprint](BLUEPRINT.md) |
| Assigned work, evidence, and implementation | [Manifest](workbench/manifest.json) -> assigned stable spec -> its referenced source/tests |
| Complete capability inventory | [Spec catalog](workbench/specs/CATALOG.md) -> stable spec; includes completed history |
| Durable knowledge and design concepts | [Wiki router](workbench/wiki/MEMORY.md) -> relevant note -> its governing sources |
| Decision rationale | [ADR register](workbench/docs/adr/REGISTER.md) -> active decision -> its operational owners; [history](workbench/docs/adr/HISTORY.md) remains explicit |
| Commands and recovery | [Runbook](RUNBOOK.md) -> relevant procedure -> named tool |

The Wiki retains its single `MEMORY.md` router. This table connects existing
owners; it does not add a second Wiki index or copy their contents.

## Ownership Rules

- Add a term only after the parties agree on its meaning.
- Put project-wide definitions here; keep capability-specific terms in the
  owning spec until they become shared.
- Definitions belong here. Requirements and decisions remain in
  `BLUEPRINT.md` or the owning `SPEC.md`.
- Surface conflicts before changing an established definition.
- Link to detailed sources instead of copying them here.

## Workbench Terms

| Term | Definition | Distinction |
|---|---|---|
| **Design concept** | The shared understanding between the parties working on a project about what that project is. | It exists between participants. `BLUEPRINT.md` helps them reconstruct it but is not itself the design concept. |
| **Traverse, don't search** | The core Workbench navigation principle: reach task-relevant context by following links from known entry points to its owners. | Bounded search repairs missing routes or investigates the selected source area; broad rediscovery is not ordinary entry. `AGENTS.md` owns the behavior. |
| **Context Map** | The navigable relationships among Workbench concepts, controls, specs, Wiki context, and referenced source/evidence, entered through this Lexicon's Task Routing. | Existing owners hold the information; any rendered map is a source-derived Projection, not another truth store or authority. No graph service or Obsidian dependency is required. |
| **Blueprint** | The adaptable narrative of the desired finished product: destination, people, outcomes, experience, integrated design, cross-cutting qualities, lifecycle and non-goals. | It supports the design concept; it is not current status, an ADR inventory, a work queue, a glossary, or a proof archive. |
| **Lexicon** | The canonical lookup table for definitions shared across the project. | It owns meanings, not requirements, implementation decisions, or work status. |
| **Spec** | A stable capability record containing scoped intent, requirements, decisions, implementation slices, acceptance, verification, evidence, and completion. | It combines the useful product and engineering roles often split between a PRD and technical spec. |
| **Ticket** | A temporary, one-context tracer-bullet slice inside a spec that produces independently verifiable progress. | It is execution structure, not durable capability history. |
| **Coordination hand-back** | A point during an assigned run where the owner had to supply something that was not a preference, tradeoff, authorization, or unavailable resource under `AGENTS.md`'s governing gate: a settled decision repeated, evidence already in the project located for the agent, a routine technical finding reconciled, or an already-authorized step prompted. | It is a defect in a record, route, skill, or tool, recorded per occurrence with its cause and smallest correction in the assigned spec's evidence log by the `carry` skill. Answering a genuine owner decision is not one, and neither is a new framework built in response to one. `AGENTS.md` Safety And Change Control owns when an owner is asked; these four reasons restate that gate and never widen it. |

## Continuity Terms

| Term | Definition | Distinction |
|---|---|---|
| **Notepad** | A local, objective-scoped JSON working record with a compact editable current view and an append-oriented work record. Grilling records are notepads and therefore JSON. | It is not Canon or permanent history; preserve important material until reconciled. One objective may use several linked notes. |
| **Scoped handoff** | A separate local Markdown (`.md`) compaction authored from the relevant notepad material with plain-language, destination-specific continuation instructions. | A receiving agent can read the file or the owner can paste it into a new chat. It is requested or initiated by the owner; a pointer requires accessible, retained source data. Preservation does not grant authority. |
| **WBID** | The visible identifier comprising an artifact's type prefix and a base-62 value replacing the numeric portion. | Unique within the type and Workbench, not globally; no parallel secondary ID. Existing numeric labels and stable paths remain readable; historical numeric tickets remain spec-qualified, while new letter-bearing tickets reserve the whole Workbench inventory. |

## Stance Terms

| Term | Definition | Distinction |
|---|---|---|
| **Stance** | The method and obligations for performing one assigned task within already established authority. | It is neither an identity nor an authority grant; switching stance creates no handoff. |
| **Builder** | The stance that delivers a scoped, verified result and maintains its documentation. | Implementation includes relevant review and verification. |
| **Auditor** | The stance that checks claims against named evidence and reports a bounded verdict. | An audit does not authorize repairs or release. |
| **Reviewer** | The stance that challenges a candidate's correctness, impact and evidence. | At integration it runs in a separate context; it does not quietly repair the candidate. |
| **Reconciler** | The stance that reconciles achieved work with the state and owners needed for continuation. | It neither manufactures completion nor duplicates truth in a universal handoff. |
| **TASK** | The assigned ticket within a stable SPEC, carrying its normal stance assignment. | No additional task file or queue is introduced. |

## Governance Core

Design-concept routing: a question about what a product, subsystem, or
relationship *is* starts here, then follows the term to the owner-directed
articles in `workbench/wiki/design-concepts/`; the Blueprint and the assigned
spec still decide when a requirement or verified Actuality matters.

Shared by every Workbench. These rows describe roles and boundaries; the
binding behavior lives in `AGENTS.md`, cross-cutting architecture in
`BLUEPRINT.md`, and rationale in the project's `workbench/docs/adr/` collection.

| Term | Definition | Distinction |
|---|---|---|
| **Governance Plane** | The role one claim plays in one operation: **Intent** (the request), **Canon** (the binding current-state rule), **Grounding** (evidence about intended truth or whether work was done correctly), **Enduring Context** (durable reference consulted), **Actuality** (the target being changed, including files, source, runtime, and verified state), and **Projection** (a source-derived report). | Planes classify claims and their use, never whole files, directories, or artifact types. One assigned spec carries Canon, Projection, Grounding, and Enduring Context claims at once. |
| **Workbench Contract** | The logical set of current claims owned by the seven root controls plus the explicitly assigned spec. | It is not a file; no `CONTRACT.md` or other coequal root control exists. |
| **Instruction authority** | What an agent may do: the current owner request, then `AGENTS.md` with platform safety, then the explicitly assigned spec as a bounded capability delegate, then the procedural controls. | An assigned spec cannot enlarge the request, platform safety, or `AGENTS.md` scope; an unassigned spec is evidence. |
| **State resolution** | How a Canon claim and verified Actuality are reconciled: newer Canon is an implementation gap, newer verified Actuality is documentation drift, unclear ordering is an ambiguity to investigate. | Neither "code always wins" nor "Canon proves implementation"; the touched owner is repaired rather than a universal precedence applied. |
| **No-governance-tax rule** | Ordinary owner-directed project work requires only the Workbench Contract and its verification; no coordination system, order form, flight, or external mechanism is a prerequisite. | Available mechanisms a change genuinely needs still apply; the line is availability, not ceremony. |
| **Diagnostic** | A registered finding a Workbench tool emits with a stable code, a severity of `error` or `attention`, a scope, and a blocking effect of `all`, `selection`, `selected-slice`, or `none`. | The consuming command enforces the effect; no artifact chooses whether its own finding blocks. |
| **Support lane** | One of the six manifest-declared slots under lowercase `workbench/`: `docs`, `specs`, `wiki`, `sessions`, `feedback`, `tools`. | A lane is a structural slot, not a plane; the count coincides with the six planes by accident. |
| **Collection** | A manifest-declared, machine-used directory inside a lane: `docs/adr`, `wiki/design-concepts`, `wiki/guidebooks`, `wiki/archive`, `sessions/grilling`, `sessions/handoffs`, `sessions/checkpoints`, `sessions/notepads`, `sessions/notepads/templates`, `sessions/recovery`. | Collection names are lowercase; local notepads may use nested type folders; a collection is never promoted to a lane because its contents differ in kind. |
| **ADR** | An architecture decision record in `workbench/docs/adr/`: title, decision, considered alternatives, consequences, provenance, and frontmatter naming its operational owners. | Active accepted ADR decision claims are architectural Canon; rationale and history remain distinct; `canonicalized_in` names operational owners. |
| **Checkpoint** | A retained historical tracked copy in `sessions/checkpoints/`; new copy creation is retired. | Preserve existing bytes and citations. New claims reconcile into their durable owners; operational recovery is separate. |
| **Operational recovery** | Local rollback receipts and backups in the ignored `sessions/recovery/` collection. | Excluded from notepad discovery and durable provenance; existing historical recovery references remain valid. |
| **Design Concept article** | An owner-authorized, encyclopedic wiki article in `wiki/design-concepts/` explaining one durable cross-cutting design model, ending with `Evidence and Sources` and carrying `History`. | It documents a design concept; it is not the Blueprint, an ADR, a procedure, or task state, and agents suggest or repair it but do not create it. |
| **Wiki profile** | The manifest's declared wiki shape: `project` (one room's memory router and collections) or `deployment` (adds owner, machine, and project pointer collections). | A profile declares routing shape; it grants no authority and copies no live task state. |
| **Managed runtime tool** | A file in `workbench/tools/` installed from the Workbench release and listed in the tools receipt with its source release, commit, and hash. | It is updated only by explicit update with backup and rollback; an application's root `tools/` is application-owned. |
| **Declared integration branch** | The branch, named by exact case in `workbench/manifest.json` `git.integrationBranch`, into which the independent review gate merges task branches; `git.defaultBranch` names the branch it is created from. | A declaration, not a prose convention: controls resolve it from the manifest, `doctor` reports it undeclared or missing without blocking selection, and only generation, adoption, and upgrade completion fail closed on it. |

## Project Terms

| Term | Definition | Distinction / aliases to avoid |
|---|---|---|
| **Room** | One repository with the Workbench installed in it: seven root controls, a `workbench/` support root declared by a manifest, and an installed managed runtime. | A room is an installation, not the harness. `LLM_Workbench` is the harness; `Example Workbench` and `Audit Workbench` are rooms. Avoid "workbench" alone when you mean one installation. |
| **Tour** | The ordered list of places in `tour.mjs`, each naming a real path with what it owns and why it is kept apart. | The tour is data that happens to print. It is not prose about the room and not a README section; the tests read the same list the terminal does. |
| **Place** | One entry in the tour: a path, its zone, the truth it owns, and the reason that truth is not kept somewhere else. | A place is not merely a directory. A directory nobody can say a "why" for does not belong in the room. |
| **Zone** | One of the three groupings a place belongs to: `Root controls`, `The support root`, `The product`. | Zones organize the explanation. They are not lanes, and the manifest does not know about them. |
| **Drift** | The condition where the room's structure and the tour's description of it disagree. | Drift is a test failure here, not a documentation backlog item. `node tests/tour.test.mjs` is what makes that true. |
## Continuity And Evidence Boundaries

- **Workbench connection identity:** the stable namespace selected for optional
  private session transport. Clones/worktrees share it; independent rooms differ.
  It is distinct from each visible, type-scoped artifact identifier.
- **Private session transport:** explicitly configured synchronization of selected
  live working records. Private Git retention changes recoverability, not the
  record's authority or durable project ownership.
- **Direct promotion:** deliberate selected-claim reconciliation into a named
  durable owner, with privacy/validity checks and verified destination recovery
  before scoped source cleanup. It is not merely a copy or commit.
- **Configured-host capability:** an operation exercised in the actual host and
  configuration. It does not establish machine enforcement or model reliability.
- **Core compatibility:** the explicit supported range between one selected
  installed global core release and room versions; a version difference alone
  is not proof of incompatibility.
